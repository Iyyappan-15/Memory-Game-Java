🧠 Memory Game (Java)

A simple, console-based Memory Game developed in Java.
The objective of the game is to uncover and match all pairs of cards by flipping two cards at a time.

This project is designed for learning and practicing core Java concepts, making it ideal for beginners who want hands-on experience with fundamental programming constructs.

📌 Project Overview

The game initializes a collection of paired cards, shuffles them randomly, and displays them on a concealed board.
During each turn, the player selects two card positions:

✅ If the cards match, they remain visible

❌ If they do not match, they are hidden again

The game continues until all card pairs are successfully matched, at which point the player wins.

✨ Features :

🎮 Interactive console-based gameplay.

🔀 Randomized card placement using Java Collections.

🛡️ Robust input validation for user selections.

🧩 Clear and beginner-friendly game logic.

📊 Clean console output for easy readability.
