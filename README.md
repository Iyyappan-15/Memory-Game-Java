# Memory Game (Java)

A simple console-based Memory Game developed using Java.  
The objective of the game is to find all matching pairs of cards by flipping two cards at a time.

This project is intended for learning and practicing core Java concepts such as arrays, collections, loops, and user input handling.

## Project Overview

The game initializes a set of card pairs, shuffles them randomly, and displays them on a hidden board.  
The player selects two card positions per turn. If the cards match, they remain visible; otherwise, they are hidden again.  
The game continues until all pairs are matched.
